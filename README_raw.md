HybridTrack is a novel 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) framework that combines the strengths of traditional Kalman filtering with the adaptability of deep learning. Designed for traffic and autonomous driving scenarios, it delivers **state-of-the-art accuracy** and **real-time performance**‚Äîno manual tuning or scenario-specific designs required.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

1. **Prepare your data:** Follow the [Data Preparation Guide](docs/create_data.md) for step-by-step instructions on downloading, organizing, and linking the KITTI dataset, detections, and annotations.
2. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure and run:**
   - For training, see [Training Guide](docs/training.md)
   - For tracking, see [Tracking Guide](docs/tracking.md)
